# NoCoSMiCC
**Non-coding Somatic Mutations in Colorectal Cancer** — robust background mutation-rate modeling and non-coding driver discovery.

## Why it matters
Large-scale studies suggest non-coding driver events can be difficult to distinguish from background processes, so rigorous modeling and confounder control are essential.

## What this project does
- Builds genome-wide background mutation-rate models over fixed bins.
- Tests candidate regulatory regions for mutation enrichment beyond expectation.
- Tracks confounders (e.g., CNV) to avoid artefactual “drivers”.
