## Data access

The analysis of non-coding somatic mutations relevant to colorectal cancer (CRC) first requires collation of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data. A large number of CRC WGS databases are now available and can be accessed by following the relevant data access procedures:

- Genomics England (https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/research/research-environment)
- Hartwig Medical Foundation (https://www.hartwigmedicalfoundation.nl/en/data/data-access-request/)
- Pan Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (https://docs.icgc.org/pcawg/data/)

We have also included our own datasets in the analysis, accessible here:

**Total CRC WGS datasets used:** > 3,000

## Mapping of conserved regulatory elements 
A key component of the initial phase of this project is the construction of colorectal regulatory element maps using the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project (https://www.encodeproject.org/). The ENCODE project aims to deliniate functional elements in the genome and contains integrated data across tissue types in human and mouse to create a catalogue of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). To create regulatory element maps for the analysis of CRC somatic mutaions in the two species, we utilise data originating only from normal colonic tissue.
